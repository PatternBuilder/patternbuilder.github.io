# Welcome to Pattern Builder

This is a suite of code that empowers your team to prototype in a static pattern library and then import the designs and content data model into Drupal with a single drush command.

Need to update your design? No problem! Just update and QA the code in your pattern library and import those changes in seconds.

PatternBuilder is a [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com) sponsored project.
